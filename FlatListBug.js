This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and attempting to update the data frequently.  The performance can degrade significantly, leading to lag, dropped frames, and eventually an unresponsive app. This is especially noticeable on lower-end devices.  The cause often lies in inefficient rendering or data handling, triggering excessive re-renders and memory issues.
