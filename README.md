# React Native FlatList Performance Optimization

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets and frequent updates. The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problematic implementation, while `FlatListBugSolution.js` provides an optimized solution.

## Problem

Using FlatList with a large dataset and frequent data changes can lead to significant performance degradation, resulting in a sluggish and unresponsive app.

## Solution

The solution focuses on optimizing data handling and rendering to minimize re-renders and improve memory management. This includes using techniques like `keyExtractor`, `getItemLayout`, and `removeClippedSubviews` to enhance performance.
